# CMN_binViewer
CMN_binViewer -- view, organize, calibrate and confirm CAMS standard meteor data

CMN_binViewer came into existence during the second part of August 2014, as a result of a dire need of new viewing software for [CAMS] (http://cams.seti.org/) and Skypatrol data. As the [Croatian Meteor Network] (http://cmn.rgn.hr/) grew in its demands, it became apparent that the existing solutions were not satisfactory.

**Features:**

1. view CAMS standard and Skypatrol standard image files in multiple filters
2. view reconstructed video from image files
3. make calibration (dark, flat) frames from meteor images
4. perform CAMS confirmation procedure
